# 10 — Benchmarking and evaluation

> Part of the TraceMaker plan. Start at [`../PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md).

## 1. Fixture sets

| Set | Source | Size | Format | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **FR-fixtures** | Freerouting `fixtures/` (GPL-3.0) | 155 DSN regression boards | DSN | Router robustness; direct comparison with Freerouting |
| **PCBench-FR** | Freerouting `scripts/benchmark` PCBench fixtures (from PCBench, MIT) | ~1,157 boards with unrouted + reference DSN, `.kicad_pcb`, `ground_truth.json` | kicad_pcb + DSN | **Main routing benchmark.** Freerouting publishes nightly results on exactly this set |
| **DAC2020 bm1–bm11** | github.com/DAC-2020-Submission-1703/PCB-Benchmarks | 11 hand-routed manufactured boards | kicad_pcb | Dense/BGA boards; compare vias and layers with the human routing |
| **KiCad demos** | KiCad 10.0 `demos/` | 19 boards | kicad_pcb | Real KiCad projects with schematics: rule ingestion, IPC plugin, schematic-to-board |
| **PCBWorld** | LGAI-Research/PCBWorld (BSD-3 code) | 679 real boards + 2 synthetic generators | kicad_pcb | Comparison with PCBWorld's published baselines (KiCad PNS, OrthoRoute, RL) |
| **RL_PCB** | LukeVassallo/RL_PCB (MIT) | small circuits | kicad_pcb | Placement comparison with a learned placer |
| **Place-and-route set** (own) | KiCad demos + PCBench boards with routing stripped and footprints scattered | built by script | kicad_pcb | Full schematic-to-routed-board evaluation |
| **Synthetic stress** (own) | generated: BGA fanout grids, dense buses, crossing lattices | parameterised | kicad_pcb | Unit benchmarks for escape, global routing and GPU kernels |

Licences differ per set; the harness downloads sets into `bench/data/` (git-ignored) from their sources
and never redistributes them.

### Building unrouted fixtures

`bench/tools/strip.py` removes `segment`/`arc`/`via` nodes (keeping locked ones and zones), and for the
place-and-route set also resets unlocked footprint positions to a pile outside the outline (what KiCad's
"Update PCB from Schematic" produces).

## 2. Metrics per board

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Clean pass** | 100% connections routed **and** zero added KiCad DRC errors (input vs output, `kicad-cli pcb drc`) |
| Completion | routed connections / routable connections (excluding pins proved dead) |
| Added DRC errors | by KiCad violation type |
| Vias, wirelength, bends | totals; also normalised to the reference routing where it exists |
| Wall time, work units | engine-reported, with hardware recorded |
| Placement (P&R set) | HPWL, lower-bound gap, crossings, courtyard overlaps (must be 0), moved parts |
| Determinism | output hash per board at 1 and N threads, GPU on/off |

## 3. Baselines

| Baseline | How it runs |
|---|---|
| **Freerouting** (current release, plus v2.5.0-RC12 as published) | Its own CLI on the DSN; SES imported back into `.kicad_pcb` by TraceMaker's SES reader; judged by the same KiCad DRC. Published nightly figure on PCBench: **74.6% clean, 74.8% fully routed** (v2.5.0-RC12, 1,157 fixtures) |
| **KiCad PNS / PCBWorld baselines** | Published PCBWorld numbers; optionally its environment (pins KiCad 9.0.8) |
| **OrthoRoute** | Published PCBWorld numbers (~1–2% clean pass on mixed boards) |
| **Human reference** | The original routing of PCBench and bm boards (vias, length) |
| **SA-PCB** | For placement HPWL on the P&R set |
| **TraceMaker previous commit** | Regression gate |

## 4. Harness (`bench/`)

- Python, driven by manifest files (`bench/manifests/*.yaml`: board list, time budget, tier).
- Tiers: `quick` (~30 boards, < 5 min total, every change), `standard` (~300 boards, nightly), `full` (all).
- Runs N boards in parallel (one engine process per board, GPU jobs shared through the engine's queue).
- Each run writes `results/<run-id>/<board>.json` and a summary; `bench/report.py` renders Markdown and an
  HTML dashboard (per-board deltas vs baseline, scatter of time vs completion, failure-cause histogram from
  the failure memory).
- **Paired comparison**: same boards, same budget, same machine; report wins/losses/ties per board, a
  sign test, and the bootstrap confidence interval of the clean-pass difference.
- **Seeds**: best-of-1 is the headline; best-of-5 is reported separately (PCBWorld reports baselines as best
  of 5, so compare like with like).

## 5. Gates (used by the roadmap)

1. No board in `quick` gets worse in clean pass or completion.
2. Zero added KiCad DRC errors on every board that was clean before.
3. Time within budget on every board.
4. Determinism hash unchanged unless the change is meant to change results (then recorded).
